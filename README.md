# Publication-Conservation-properties-of-the-augmented-basis-update-Galerkin-integrator

This repository can be used to reproduce all numerical experiments of the paper "Conservation properties of the augmented basis update & Galerkin integrator for kinetic problems" by Einkemmer, Kusch and Schotth√∂fer.

To run the code, download and install the Julia programming environment (https://julialang.org/downloads/) and navigate into one of the subfolders. Open the Julia REPL (by typing julia into the command line). Press the ] key to open the package manager and type activate . and instantiate to download and install all required packages.
